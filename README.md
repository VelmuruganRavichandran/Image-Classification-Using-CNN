# Image Classification

## Project Description

This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images of cats and dogs. The model leverages image preprocessing and augmentation techniques, such as rescaling, shearing, and flipping, to enhance the training data and improve model robustness. The CNN architecture includes multiple layers for feature extraction and classification, culminating in a binary output layer. The model is trained on a labeled dataset and evaluated on unseen test images, showcasing its ability to accurately differentiate between the two animal classes.

## Technologies Used

- **NumPy**: Numerical computing
- **Warnings**: Handling warnings in code
- **TensorFlow**: Deep learning framework for building and training the CNN
- **Keras**: High-level API for building and training neural networks
- **ImageDataGenerator**: Data augmentation and preprocessing
- **keras.preprocessing.image**: Utilities for image processing

## Dataset Information

The dataset used for this project consists of images of dogs and cats. The images are pre-split into separate training and testing folders.

## Results

The model is capable of making predictions by providing an image as input. It classifies the image as either a cat or a dog based on the learned features from the training data.
